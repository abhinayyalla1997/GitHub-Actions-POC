React Application Deployment with AWS S3, CloudFront, and Lambda
Overview
This project automates the deployment of a React application using GitHub Actions, AWS S3, CloudFront, and Lambda for cache management. The workflow ensures fast, secure, and seamless deployment, enabling developers to push updates efficiently while ensuring end users receive the latest content.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

GitHub Actions: Automates the build and deployment of the React application.
AWS S3: Stores the static React build files.
AWS CloudFront: Serves the content globally with high performance using a CDN.
AWS Lambda: Clears the CloudFront cache automatically when new files are uploaded.
Route53: Manages the domain routing for accessing the application.
How It Works
Developer Workflow
Code Push
Developers push their code changes to the GitHub repository.

GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions automatically:

Builds the React application.
Uploads the build files to the designated S3 bucket.
CloudFront Distribution
CloudFront fetches content from the S3 bucket and serves it globally.

Cache Clearing via Lambda
When new files are uploaded to S3, an AWS Lambda function clears the CloudFront cache, ensuring end users see the latest updates.

Command Example:
Ensure the S3 bucket is ready, then deploy:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
User Workflow
Access the Application
Users visit the React application using a domain name configured via Route53.

Content Delivery

CloudFront ensures fast content delivery.
CloudFront fetches the content from the S3 bucket.
Dynamic Content Updates
Users receive the latest updates because Lambda clears the cache automatically after deployment.

S3 Bucket Policy
Below is the bucket policy that ensures content is accessible only via CloudFront using Origin Access Identity (OAI):

json
Copy code
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::cloudfront:user/CloudFront Origin Access Identity E3N8IEGFMS3GGU"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-reactdemo-bucket/*"
        }
    ]
}
Key Points:
Content Restriction: S3 content is restricted from direct public access.
CloudFront: Only CloudFront can fetch content using the Origin Access Identity (OAI).
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following:

AWS Account: Access to AWS services (S3, CloudFront, Lambda, IAM, Route53).
GitHub Repository: Your React application code should be pushed to GitHub.
Node.js: Install Node.js to build the React project locally.
AWS CLI: Configured to manage S3 and Lambda.
Bash: For scripting purposes (optional).
Deployment Steps
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository containing the React application:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Step 2: Configure GitHub Actions
Set up GitHub Actions with the workflow file:

Define your AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets.
Add the deployment script to push build files to S3.
Step 3: Build the React Application
Build the project locally (optional):

bash
Copy code
npm install
npm run build
Step 4: Deploy
Push your changes to trigger the deployment:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
Example Workflow Commands
Build and Deploy React App
bash
Copy code
npm install
npm run build
aws s3 cp ./build s3://my-react-bucket/ --recursive
Clear CloudFront Cache Using AWS CLI
bash
Copy code
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id <Your-Distribution-ID> --paths "/*"
Technologies Used
React: Front-end application.
AWS S3: Static file storage.
AWS CloudFront: Content delivery network (CDN).
AWS Lambda: Cache invalidation for CloudFront.
GitHub Actions: CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.
AWS Route53: Domain management.
